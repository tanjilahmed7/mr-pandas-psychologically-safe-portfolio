# Areas of improvement / things to do

- Generate hitboxes for hovered items that way it won't leave the area and flicker back constantly.
- Add some cool burning paper shader effects.
- Use texture atlases/spritesheets for animations.
- More easter eggs.
- Try making one that go forwards and diagonal or rotates camera upside down.
- Try making different scenes and cute paper animations like a campfire.
